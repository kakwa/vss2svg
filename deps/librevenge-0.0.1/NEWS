librevenge 0.0.1

- Fix license headers in some files.
- Export API symbols on windows.
- Really allow to disable build without streams and generators.
- Detect CppUnit in configure already.
- Drop dependency of librevenge-stream to Boost.Filesystem.
- Do not throw exception when constructing RVNGDirectoryStream for an unexistent
  directory. Instead, create a valid dummy stream that will respond negatively
  to all operations (for consistency with RVNGFileStream).
- Fix return type of RVNGBinaryData::getDataStream(). This change does affect
  neither API nor ABI.
- Add some documentation for RVNGBinaryData.
- Create a Coverity model covering the majority of librevenge data types, for
  the benefit of projects that use librevenge.
- Several minor improvements and fixes.
